# Implementation status

## Latest — production pixel-art pipeline handoff (2026-10-04)

Created `MASTER_DESIGN.md` as Resonance's stable project-wide design spine and
adopted a canonical LibreSprite production-art workflow for authored raster
characters.

This decision follows repeated Conductor frame-consistency problems in earlier
generated artwork: anatomy/grip drift, baton geometry changes, registration
mismatch, alpha/matte cleanup and unreliable in-betweens. Existing approved
Conductor design, Ictus motion/timing, wrist-core registration, idle behavior and
review labs remain reference canon; no approved gameplay or animation timing is
being discarded.

The production-art foundation will be rebuilt deliberately: approved reference →
Codex production translation → layered LibreSprite source → runtime export →
isolated animation-lab comparison → user approval. Whole-character frame-by-frame
2D remains the animation model. Baton glow, attacks, particles and other suitable
effects remain runtime effects.

**Handoff:** the dedicated Resonance Master Design chat should read
`MASTER_DESIGN.md` first and continue by planning the canonical Conductor
LibreSprite base pose, followed by an Ictus reconstruction/side-by-side review.
Do not expand production Conductor animation from inconsistent generated raster
sources before that migration is evaluated.

## Latest — Changing Meter phrase and deployed dev archive (2026-09-19)

Added `meter-phrase-lab.html`, the first continuous whole-hand five-beat phrase
grouped `3+2`. Twenty true-alpha raster drawings retain one fixed wrist-core
registration and constant scale, with a live tracked baton-tip effect. The
approved review mapping is one-lane arc, rest, two-lane arc, two-lane abstract
organ-pipe barrier, then one-lane arc. Attacks are separate Canvas effects;
absorbables remain stage-owned and absent. This is an animation review, not a
final encounter chart.

The focused second pass now uses authored frame holds instead of uniform timing,
synchronizes attacks and tip flashes to exact beat releases, preserves active
attacks across the loop boundary, and resolves through two dedicated return
drawings into the exact opening pose. A paused Ictus comparison mode exposes
scale, wrist-core registration, brightness and palette through same-position
Phrase, Ictus and Overlay views at their actual playback scales.
The comparison exposed an 8–10% undersized phrase silhouette, so phrase playback
now uses scale `1.96` and its return bridge uses the proportional scale `0.76`.
The fixed wrist-core anchor is unchanged.

The title screen now includes `DEV PROGRESSION`. Its in-game index links to the
current Changing Meter, continuity, idle, Ictus and timing studies, plus a clearly
collapsed archive of earlier rig/finger/pose experiments. Every route uses the
Vite/GitHub Pages base path so the index remains usable after deployment. This is
temporary development UI intended for the user's remote GitHub Pages testing.
The index uses plain animation-focused names such as `Idle Animation`,
`Ictus Attack Animation` and `Changing Meter Animation` rather than internal
review phrases.

## Latest — Conductor idle simplified to a floating hand (2026-09-19)

User clarified that the idle's primary motion is a simple whole-character hover,
not near-still mechanical breathing. The active two-second loop now moves the
complete hand twelve canvas pixels upward and back to its exact baseline using a
smooth rise-and-fall curve. The existing sixteen whole-hand drawings remain only
for restrained secondary follow-through in the free fingers, cloth strips and
hanging ornaments. Runtime still plays those drawings 1→16→1, so their motion and
the vertical float reverse together without a reset. No lateral displacement,
scale change or progressive climb is applied. Both ends have zero vertical offset,
preserving the approved wrist-core registration at the idle/Ictus seams. The live
baton-tip effect follows the translated drawing.

## Latest — Idle-to-Ictus continuity loop ready for review (2026-09-14)

Added isolated `continuity-lab.html`: one approved idle cycle now flows into the
complete approved Ictus body motion and recovery, then directly into another idle
cycle. A shared animated baton-tip effect follows both sprite sets. No hazards,
gameplay or source artwork changed. Idle matte isolation was extracted into a
shared helper so the idle-only and continuity labs use identical cleaned frames.
The first continuity review exposed an oversized, off-center and overly bright
idle sheet. An intermediate correction fixed the direction but still
reconstructed the hand-to-baton proportions. Active
`conductor-idle-sheet-review-03.png` instead
derives from sixteen exact copies of the approved first Ictus cell, then adds only
idle micro-movement. Both renderers register its measured wrist-core anchor to
the same canvas coordinate and retain Ictus's approved presentation scale. See
`idle-ictus-continuity-review-01.md` and `conductor-idle-sheet-review-03.md`.
Await user judgment of visual identity and motion at both seams before authoring
any bridge drawings.

## Latest — Conductor upright idle loop ready for review (2026-09-14)

Added isolated `idle-lab.html`: sixteen generated whole-hand drawings form a
provisional two-second upright idle loop based on the user-approved final Ictus
pose. The palm stays centered, the baton remains vertical and the five-digit
thumb/index grip is preserved. Baton-tip magic is a separate live effect rather
than a baked static star. Because the generated review sheet returned a painted
checkerboard, the lab removes only bright neutral matte pixels in memory; a true-
alpha extraction that introduced colored edge noise was rejected. Follow-up
review removed residual white fringe with edge-connected matte flooding and made
the live sparkle track each drawing's detected baton tip instead of a fixed
screen coordinate. A second review correction darkens one exposed pixel of
remaining pale edge contamination and plays drawings 1→16→1, eliminating the generated
sheet's progressive rise followed by an abrupt low reset. A third correction
replaces fractional sprite-sheet crops with shared integer cell bounds, removing
the next row's baton-tip pixel that appeared below drawings 9–12 in both playback
directions. A four-pixel bottom gutter also excludes paint that the generated
sheet placed across its own row boundary. Existing approved Ictus art and gameplay
remain untouched. See
`conductor-idle-sheet-review-01.md`. Await user motion and consistency review.

## Latest — Changing Meter timing lab ready for review (2026-09-14)

Added isolated `meter-lab.html`: a twelve-second, 120 BPM Web Audio click study
for the provisional 16–28 second encounter passage. It presents two five-pulse
bars grouped `3+2`, then two grouped `2+3`, with strong/weak clicks, deliberate
rests and placeholder red arcs on a five-lane field. Music time is authoritative
for playback; the timeline can also be inspected without audio. No Conductor art,
production encounter, HP variant, absorbable, title or Options change. See
`changing-meter-timing-sketch-01.md`. Await user judgment before animation work.

## Latest design correction — resonance ownership (2026-09-13)

Absorbable resonance events are stage-authored opportunities, never boss attacks
and never spawned, promised or telegraphed by boss animations. The shared
prototype chart remains a timing/collision container only; its TypeScript naming
and comments now encode that ownership boundary. Removed the obsolete Resonant
Invitation from The Conductor's authoritative animation/move-pool direction.
Changing Meter is an encounter/music structure realized through continuous
conducting phrase clips, not one animation type.

## Latest — Ictus attack release ready for review (2026-09-13)

`windup-lab.html?mode=attack` keeps the approved whole-character Ictus drawings
unchanged and adds a separate tracked baton charge, release flash and six-event
red-arc phrase over a faint five-lane field. Release occurs on the forward-pointing
drawing at 244 ms; the character rebounds immediately. The sample demonstrates
one-, two- and three-lane widths but is not a locked boss chart or final music
sync. See `ictus-attack-release-review-01.md`. Unit tests and production build
pass; the focused attack browser check passes and its phone screenshots were
visually inspected. Await user review of the gesture-to-release connection.

## Latest — complete Ictus recovery ready for review (2026-09-13)

User approved corrected 2D wind-up + stroke. `windup-lab.html?mode=ictus` now
adds the established 940 ms recovery for a 1200 ms complete motion. It rebounds
immediately from pointing (no endpoint hold), traverses approved whole-hand
drawings in reverse anatomical order, and settles on upright idle. Full and
recovery-only playback, quarter speed and scrub are available. No new generated
frames or combat integration. See `ictus-recovery-review-01.md`. 46 unit tests,
build and three focused browser tests pass. Await user motion review.

## Latest — corrected stroke connected for review (2026-09-13)

User preferred second stroke sheet and requested frame7 baton correction.
`ictus-stroke-baton-fixed-03.png` removes extra upright spike, retains forward
baton. `windup-lab.html?mode=stroke` joins approved wind-up (130 ms) and corrected
stroke (130 ms). Normal/quarter speed, scrub, endpoint inspection. Build and
two browser tests pass. Motion approval pending; recovery not included.
Earlier rejection records below describe prior alternatives, not this correction.

## Latest checkpoint — fast stroke unsuccessful (2026-09-13)

User approved fine-tip wind-up and authorized stroke into pointing at player.
Two generated sheets failed visual review: insufficient wrist bend, abrupt late
pose changes and conflicting baton geometry. Saved rejected sheets and exact
prompts in `docs/bosses/conductor/key-poses/stroke-attempts-2026-09-13/`.
No runtime changes or combined preview. Stroke remains incomplete. Next targeted
work: resolve one intermediate wrist/grip pose before expanding to a sequence.
Continue whole-character 2D frames. No 3D rig work.

Reference footage informs expressive movement quality; timing follows conducting
technique, personality and our music/combat, not reference boss pauses/rhythms.

## Active direction — back to 2D whole-hand drawings

User accepted the eight-frame wind-up except for the round baton-tip knobs.
Those were replaced with fine tapered tips in `ictus-windup-fine-tips-02.png`
using one built-in image edit. Preview uses the versioned sheet; timing and
registration are unchanged. Original sheet retained. No new attack/rig work.

User rejected further 3D rig development and explicitly chose the upright-baton
reference and whole-hand 2D frames. Finger studies are preserved only as history.
New bounded review: `windup-lab.html`, eight generated drawings across only the
130 ms preparation, normal/quarter speed, scrub/replay. One generation attempt.
This is a review draft with remaining detail/proportion variation, NOT approved
production animation. Original reference and earlier previews unchanged.
See `docs/bosses/conductor/key-poses/ictus-windup-eight-frame-study-01.md` for
provenance, exact prompt and limitations. Stop for user motion review.

## Latest checkpoint — complete-finger extension

User approved the single joint and authorized one complete finger. Preview:
`finger-lab.html?mode=full`. Three tapered segments, three connected pivots,
coordinated continuous curl, original material treatment. Old sample is preserved
with comparison links. No whole hand, wrist or combat changes. See
`docs/bosses/conductor/finger-sample.md` for scope and review notes.
44 unit tests and two focused browser tests pass; production build passes.
Stop for user judgment of the full-finger motion before any further expansion.

## Latest checkpoint — bounded moving finger sample

User authorized ONLY one continuously bending ivory/brass finger to evaluate a
constructed-source approach. New `finger-lab.html` is separate from all existing
labs and combat. Two closed tapered ivory segments, a fixed concentric brass
hinge, seeded object-space surface wear/cracks, low-resolution nearest-neighbor
rendering. Continuous 0–72-degree flexion, pause, scrub, front/side views and
portrait interruption. No generated raster assets, full hand or production rig.

The procedural study follows the scoped material/attachment guidance described
in `docs/bosses/conductor/finger-sample.md`; it is NOT a certified reference
reconstruction. Viewed phone screenshots at straight/bent front and bent side.
One material correction strengthened front-facing fissures and brass-cap light.
Continuous updates/pause/side-view browser test passed with clean exit; lint,
43 unit tests, production build and formatting passed. Existing chunk advisory
remains. No full-game/physical-phone performance claim.

Stop here for user judgment: does this moving sample fit the desired visual
language? Do not infer approval or expand to a complete hand automatically.

## Latest animation checkpoint — generated in-betweens rejected (2026-09-12)

User rejected the three-pose styled preview as too few frames/a hack job and
authorized proper in-between work. Two 16-cell sheets, one midpoint redraw and
one construction-guided midpoint were generated with the built-in image tool.
All failed visual QA: duplicate poses, baton shortening rather than wrist
flexion, or changed anatomy/grip. Saved with exact prompts and rejection reasons
in `docs/bosses/conductor/key-poses/inbetween-attempts-2026-09-12/README.md`.
No replacement animation was achieved. No runtime code, approved motion or active
preview changed this turn. Do not describe the three-pose study as approved or
reopen it as an improvement. A different consistent-source workflow needs user
discussion before implementation; no production-rig change is authorized.

## Latest art-review checkpoint — styled pose blocking (2026-09-12)

User authorized assembling existing styled artwork around the approved wrist
timing. New separate `styled-lab.html` shows three whole-image poses (upright idle,
clean wind-up, clean strike) registered at the wrist core. It samples the unchanged
`wristMotion` angle and selects the nearest available key drawing; it DOES NOT
provide smooth in-between motion or a finished Ictus animation. Recovery currently
reuses the nearest available strike/idle, not a new recovery drawing.

No new raster assets, morphing, crossfades, hand deformations or production rig.
The idle retains its baked tip sparkle; separate animated tip FX are not done.
Silhouette/ornament differences between the drawings remain visible and need
resolving before final animation. Do not treat this assembly as user approval.
The prior detailed lab, approved low-detail wrist lab, and Dummy remain unchanged.

Lint, 42 unit tests and production build passed. The new phone-emulated browser
test passed with a clean exit: loading, key inspection, playback to idle, slow
playback and pause on blur. Three phone screenshots were visually inspected.
Next: user reviews the assembly; missing in-betweens and consistent silhouette
remain actual artwork work, not something additional FPS alone will solve.

## Latest engineering checkpoint — encounter separation (2026-09-12)

Completed the user-approved small EncounterDefinition refactor. Dummy content is
in `src/game/encounters/dummy.ts`; its original chart has a pre-refactor regression
snapshot. Battle, Transport, arena beat pulse, HUD timing/labels/health and saved
records now use the selected encounter. The existing Dummy storage key remains
unchanged. Shared five-lane/player mechanics remain in `src/game/config.ts`.

The app still selects Dummy only. A test-only 90 BPM, 64-second encounter with a
three-beat count-in and two boss HP checks isolation. No renderer migration,
animation changes, tempo maps, loaders or broad framework work was performed.
The approved Conductor wrist-motion/art checkpoint below remains unchanged;
the styled wind-up still needs review in motion, not isolated-pose approval.

Verification: lint, TypeScript/Vite production build, all 39 unit tests and all
six gameplay Playwright checks passed (Chrome, phone/desktop emulation). The
browser suite includes touch/multitouch, pause/orientation, fullscreen, retry,
small-screen layout and an audio-clock victory with record persistence.
All six cases reported OK, but the runner hung during cleanup and was interrupted;
the browser run therefore did not produce a clean process exit.
The pre-refactor Dummy chart snapshot is unchanged and its winning route passes
at 5, 30 and 60 updates/second. Full formatting check passes after removing an
extra trailing blank line from four existing Conductor pose-note files.
The existing Three.js chunk-size advisory remains; no deployment configuration
changes were needed. No commit, push or live GitHub deployment was performed.

## Model workflow preference

Before beginning any development-level implementation for the game—including edits
to game code, assets, build configuration, tests, or deployment files—tell the user
first so they can switch to GPT-6 Astra High if needed. Do not begin that
implementation in the same turn as the reminder unless the user has already said
they are using GPT-6 Astra High. Planning, design discussion, research, and review
can continue on GPT-5.6 Sol Medium.

## Current checkpoint — low-detail wrist motion test

Latest: user approved styled strike `ictus-styled-grip-review-01.png`, with the
baton-tip effect to be separate. Created `ictus-styled-strike-clean-01.png` and
`ictus-styled-windup-review-01.png` in conductor/key-poses. Tip sparkle absent,
wrist-core light retained. Wind-up awaiting review; see `ictus-clean-windup-notes.md`
for exact prompts and limits. No motion/preview changes and no tip effect code yet.

UPDATE: User approved `ictus-grip-construction-01.png` anatomy/grip. A single
styled review frame is now `docs/bosses/conductor/key-poses/ictus-styled-grip-review-01.png`
(exact prompt and notes in adjacent `.md`). Ivory/brass/crimson styling applied
over the approved construction; awaiting styled-frame approval. Do not assume
this approves final animation or that generated frames are registered consistently.
Approved wrist motion/timing and active previews unchanged.

Latest artwork review: `docs/bosses/conductor/key-poses/ictus-grip-construction-01.png`
is a simplified cel-shaded anatomy study from the approved player/side strike
captures, without ornate decoration. Five digits and separate thumb/index pinch
are clearer; awaiting user review before styling. It is not final art, and the
approved motion remains unchanged. Exact prompt and review notes are in the
adjacent `.md`. User explicitly requires all work be done here, without hiring
or outsourcing; do not propose a commissioned artist again.

Reference pack prepared at `docs/bosses/conductor/animation-reference/approved-wrist/`:
eight direct canvas PNGs (idle 0 ms, wind-up 130 ms, strike 260 ms, recovery 600 ms;
player and side views), paired `index.html`, and `ARTIST_BRIEF.md` with exact timing,
source hierarchy, anatomy constraints and delivery/review guidance. The reproducible
capture script is `scripts/capture-wrist-reference.mjs`. Sandboxed Chrome navigation
timed out; the approved outside-sandbox run captured all eight successfully.
Strike and wind-up exports visually inspected; lint passed. No approved motion,
gameplay or active detailed artwork changed. Next work is artwork based on these
references, not further changes to the approved timing.

UPDATE: User enthusiastically approved the motion and explicitly praised the
initial wrist extension. Preserve the wind-up, flick and rebound timing exactly.
An authorized attempt to transfer the beat to detailed artwork is saved in
`docs/bosses/conductor/key-poses/ictus-approved-motion-beat-draft-01.md`.
The image is NOT approved: baton tip/grip remain visually incorrect. The approved
rough movement and both live preview implementations remain unchanged.

User authorized a separate low-detail motion test before more detailed pose work.
`wrist-lab.html` is a disposable Three.js study: fixed cuff, one wrist rotation,
five fixed digit paths and rigid baton grip. Player/side views, Play/Pause,
quarter speed, beat inspection and scrub are provided. Compact 130 ms preparation,
130 ms flick, immediate 940 ms recovery; no pointing hold. This is NOT a return
to a production modular rig, not finished character art, and not integrated into
combat. Existing detailed preview and assets are unchanged. Reference: user's
Flo321321ic.mp4, with deliberate suppression of whole-arm travel.

Lint, all 27 unit tests and production build passed. Live browser playback returned
to idle; side-view beat inspection exposed a framing issue corrected by centering
the side camera on the depth arc. Await user judgment of motion before art work.

## Previous checkpoint — wrist-led correction needed

User rejected the complete gesture as a whole-hand lunge/pose swap and authorized
a wrist-led revision, keeping the upright idle. Three generated redraws failed
visual review: finger/grip changes and baton shortening still do not convey the
required wrist flexion. No animation code or active frames changed in this pass.
The final rejected draft and prompt are in
`docs/bosses/conductor/key-poses/wrist-study-rejected/README.md`.
Next: obtain a short reference for the specific wrist flick, resolve the bent-wrist
key pose, then rebuild motion. Do not treat the previous preview as approved.

## Previous checkpoint — complete Ictus gesture review (2026-09-11)

User selected the accepted upright rebound as the new resting idle, then
authorized completing the missing preparation/strike and joining the recovery.
The lab now plays upright idle → preparation → fast strike → measured recovery
→ upright idle. Release cue at 200 ms; total 1000 ms. Nine unique whole-hand
drawings, including two new preparation/downstroke assets. This is sparse motion
blocking for review; smoothness and final effects remain unfinished. No projectile
or music added. See `docs/bosses/conductor/key-poses/ictus-complete-notes.md` for
prompts and limits. `src/lab/ictus-score.ts` owns phase timing; no uniform playback
rate is implied by the drawing count. Play/Replay, quarter speed and scrub remain.

Verification: lint, 24 unit tests, TypeScript/build and formatting passed. Two
browser playback/scrubbing scenarios passed; the missing-image scenario stalled
on both attempts and was interrupted, so that check remains unverified. In-app
Play was also exercised successfully, ending at upright idle at 1.00 s.

## Previous checkpoint — short transition review (2026-09-11)

Playback fix: in-app preview threw an undefined-frame error on Play. A first RAF
timestamp earlier than the click's performance.now() made elapsed time negative.
Clamp elapsed deltas and lower-bound the frame index. Added a regression scenario
that supplies a stale initial RAF timestamp; verify playback in the live tab too.

Both strike and rebound draft keys are approved. The user requested the next
step immediately. The lab now plays a seven-drawing, 0.4-second strike-to-rebound
excerpt with quarter-speed playback, scrubbing and an original-reference toggle.
Five in-betweens were generated individually and the whole drawings registered
by wrist position and uniform scale. See `docs/bosses/conductor/key-poses/transition-01/README.md`
for exact prompts, source provenance and visual limitations. Review coherence
before adding more drawings. This is sparse motion blocking, not a finished
smooth animation. No return or fast pre-strike approach is included yet.

## Previous checkpoint — rebound pose (2026-09-11)

User accepted the strike drawing as a draft (“its okay”) and authorized the
upright rebound pose. Created `docs/bosses/conductor/key-poses/ictus-rebound-review-01.png`
with a vertical slender baton and five distinct digits. Its prompts and review
limits are in `key-poses/rebound-notes.md`. Rebound approval is pending. Next after
approval: register the two poses and test a short transition. No in-betweens or
runtime changes made during this pose pass.

## Previous checkpoint — single strike pose (2026-09-11)

Created `docs/bosses/conductor/key-poses/ictus-strike-review-01.png` from the
original reference, then corrected its upward shaft to an end-on tip. Exact
prompts and visual limitations are in that folder's README. This is one
black-background pose for user review. No animation, transition frames, or lab
replacement were made. Subsequently accepted as a draft, not final production art.

## Previous checkpoint — original-reference reset (2026-09-11)

The user rejected v3's visual result. The lab at `/resonance/conductor-lab.html`
now displays the original `Conductor_visual_transparent.png` as a static reference,
registered around the palm, with full-size viewing and fullscreen.
The v3 generated keys, frames, source sheet, runtime atlas and extraction script
were removed. Animation-only lab modules and their obsolete score tests were
removed; Git history retains prior tracked experiments. V1/v2 art remains
historical and is not loaded by the reference page.

Recovery copy of the rejected v3 work:
`C:/Users/HAIZAR~1/AppData/Local/Temp/resonance-v3-rejected-ddf3f922-cbf6-41c8-a64d-80bc28df9d11.zip`.
This temporary local backup is outside the repository and can be cleared by the OS.

Keep the approved motion intent: rapid, almost abrupt approach to a directly
player-facing baton strike; measured upward rebound and return; no hold at the
upright pose. The earlier 0.20-second strike / 0.80-second recovery is a provisional
timing study, not a requirement to retain its drawings or exact frame counts.
Next: approve each key pose individually against the original reference, then
validate one short transition before commissioning a full animation. No new poses
or animation are part of this reset. Full generated atlases failed visual review.
See `docs/bosses/conductor/animation-direction.md`.

Suggested commit: `Reset Conductor lab to original reference artwork`.

## Previous checkpoint — clean Ictus v2 and live baton magic (2026-09-11)

User rejected v1's white outline noise and rigid baked star. Rebuilt the hand
sheet on a green key, removed the key with explicit prior authorization, and
exported 30 PNG drawings plus a PNG/JSON atlas. Current runtime asset is
`public/assets/conductor-lab/ictus-whole-hand-v2.*`. Metadata now drives frame
rectangles, palm registration and physical baton-tip attachment.

Character playback: 30 fps. Canvas and effects: native display refresh; removed
15/30 display throttles. Separate pulse, sparks, trail and release flare animate
from song time. Release moved to 16/30 seconds with a matching audio accent.
See `docs/bosses/conductor/animation-drafts/ictus-v2-notes.md` for exact generation
prompt, extraction details, outputs and remaining visual-review limits.

Build, ESLint and 26 unit tests pass. All four updated browser scenarios passed
(three together, then the first after fixing its numeric slider input). The first
checks changing magic on an identical resting hand frame after all attacks have
left. Final 390x844 ready/strike/rebound screenshots show clean edges and attached
tip effects. Repository formatting also passes. No remote deployment performed.
Suggested commit: `Refine Conductor animation and add live baton magic`.

## Previous checkpoint — whole-hand Ictus v1 (2026-09-11)

The approved v4 storyboard has a first animated draft in
`/resonance/conductor-lab.html`. The user authorized local alpha recovery after
two built-in image-generation attempts painted a checkerboard into RGB pixels.
The recovered PNG/JSON atlas is `public/assets/conductor-lab/ictus-whole-hand-v1.*`;
24 individual PNG frames and generation provenance are in
`docs/bosses/conductor/animation-drafts/`. See its README for extraction limits.

The complete hand is sampled at 24 fps for one second, then rests for one second.
The forward strike releases a staggered 2-lane, 1-lane, 3-lane red-arc formation.
Vertical rebound has no programmed hold. The clip uses the existing audio clock,
pause/fullscreen/portrait lifecycle and scrub/dropped-draw inspection controls.
The old `src/lab/rig.ts` and `parts.png` were removed; Git history retains them.
The playable Three.js prototype is unchanged.

ESLint, TypeScript, build, formatting and all 26 unit tests pass. Four updated
Chrome study scenarios passed before final matte/CSS cleanup. Final 390x844
screenshots confirm the grip opening is clear, the upright baton fits, and the
clip remains playing across a loop. Main-game browser regressions were not rerun
in this pass. This is a motion-review draft: grip detail varies and the frontal
strike-to-vertical rebound needs visual review. No production art approval or
remote deployment is implied. Suggested commit: `Add whole-hand Ictus animation preview`.

## Historical checkpoint — Conductor motion study (2026-09-10)

Latest artifact: `docs/bosses/conductor/storyboards/ictus-poses-v4.png`, a five-pose
storyboard created from `Conductor_visual_transparent.png` with built-in image
generation. It is ready for gesture/silhouette review, not approved production
frames. At the user's request, pose04 now aims toward the player/camera with a
foreshortened baton; v1's lower-left strike is superseded. See
`storyboards/ictus-v2-notes.md` for that revision. Pose05 now remains frontal with
the baton vertically upward and passes immediately back toward01, with no hold.
The user rejected v3's grip perspective. V4 redraws the thumb/index pinch around
a separate vertical baton handle and restores all three free fingers.
See `storyboards/ictus-v4-notes.md` for the latest edit prompts and review limits.
`storyboards/README.md` records earlier prompts and remaining alignment/detail
issues. No animation or game code changed in this storyboard pass. Resume with
the user's review before producing the full Ictus animation and live preview.

**Design decision after phone review:** the fully modular body-part rig is
rejected. Restart Conductor production animation from the original canonical
reference using complete authored hand-frame clips. Do not use the later idle WebP
as an asset or starting point. Share neutral, raised-preparation and closed-cutoff
poses instead of building every pairwise transition; ordinary clips include their
own preparation and recovery. Preserve the proven audio-clock frame selection and
release synchronization. See
`docs/bosses/conductor/animation-direction.md` for the locked direction.

Implemented a separate `/resonance/conductor-lab.html` PixiJS 8 technical study.
The existing Three.js game remains intact. It includes a temporary generated
cutout hand with 15 nested finger joints, idle/Ictus/finger clips, an audio-clock
pose sampler, timing clicks, scrubbing, pause, fullscreen and drawing diagnostics.
See `docs/bosses/conductor/rig-study.md` for scope and remaining decision gates,
and `rig-study-art.md` beside it for asset provenance and exact generation prompts.

Build, ESLint, TypeScript, 26 unit tests, repository formatting and diff checks
pass. All 11 Chrome browser scenarios passed together (2.6 minutes, exit 0):
four study checks plus all seven existing game regressions, including a real
audio-clock victory. Rendered Ictus and finger poses were visually inspected.
The built study page and its atlas both return HTTP 200 under `/resonance/`.
The first runner stalled during managed-server teardown after reporting its
results; rerunning against a separately started preview completed cleanly.

No PixiJS migration decision, production art approval or PixelOver/Aseprite
pipeline validation is implied. Phone review found synchronized timing but rejected
the rig's crab-like silhouette, off-center palm, weak Ictus and subtle fingers. No
commit, push or remote deployment has been performed by the agent.

Suggested commit summary: `Add isolated Conductor animation study`.
After push and a green Pages workflow, open
<https://jtyneham.github.io/resonance/conductor-lab.html>.
The existing workflow already builds and publishes both entries; no Pages
settings change is required. Two older design documents received formatting-only
cleanup so the existing CI formatting gate can pass; their prose is preserved.

## Earlier prototype checkpoint

Previous checkpoint: **phone playtest revision 2 complete and locally verified**
(2026-09-09). The first prototype is live on GitHub Pages. Revision 2 implements
automatic absorption, faster/shorter jump, landing input buffer, faster movement
animation, shorter field, slower attacks, cleaner title, raised controls, subtle
haptics, no active-lane marker, softer resonance-wave styling and a gently glowing
charged button. These revision-2 edits are uncommitted and ready for user review.

Follow-up: removed the stationary projectile pre-spawn interval after live-preview
feedback. The dummy chart's variety/speed remains unvalidated by the human test and
needs a dedicated chart pass before asking for another speed judgment.

- [x] Save specification and continuation checklist.

## Verified results

- Revision 2: `npm run check`, formatting and `git diff --check` pass. The revised
  Vitest suite has 21 focused tests, including automatic grounded absorption,
  jumping a resonance wave, full-charge absorption, late landing input buffering,
  revised travel values and a zero-damage winning route.
- All seven Chrome browser scenarios completed successfully against the revision-2
  production build. The key revised title/options/storage, touch/rotation and real
  AudioContext victory scenarios were rerun together and exited cleanly (2 passed,
  1.2 minutes for the final focused run). Revised screenshots were inspected.
- Haptics use the optional Vibration API with a 7 ms pulse. Unsupported browsers
  simply omit vibration; physical-phone feel remains a human playtest item.

- The first deployed revision passed ESLint, 22 Vitest combat tests, TypeScript and Vite build.
- `npm run format:check`: passes. `git diff --check`: passes.
- Seven Playwright tests pass in installed Google Chrome against the production
  build at `/resonance/` (six flow tests together, plus the render test separately).
- Three cross-browser tests pass in installed Microsoft Edge: multitouch and
  rotation/pause, fullscreen and defeat/retry, and wide-wave rendering.
- Browser tests cover a real AudioContext-driven win via normal keyboard handlers,
  saved clear record, volume/reduced-motion persistence, all five lane labels,
  simultaneous jump/move touches, frozen pause, explicit resume after rotation,
  fullscreen toggle, defeat/retry and desktop keyboard controls.
- Layouts checked at 320x568, 390x844, Pixel 7 portrait, 412x915 and 1440x900.
  Screenshots inspected for title, battle, defeat and wide-wave presentation.
- Unit tests prove a zero-damage winning route through the main phrases and coda.
  They covered the original manual absorb window and priority, shot interception,
  one airborne lane move, low/tall collisions, immunity, retry and timeout ordering.
- Fixed a real async resume/rotation race caught by the browser suite, guarded
  pending transitions, and adjusted small-screen/title safe-area spacing.
- The Three.js bundle produces Vite's advisory >500 KB raw chunk warning
  (~133 KB compressed). Build succeeds; no downloaded art or audio is required.

## Next steps for the user

1. In GitHub Desktop, review Changes on main.
2. Commit summary: `Build mobile-first Resonance prototype`.
3. Commit to main, then Push origin.
4. Wait for the `Build and deploy Resonance` workflow's green result.
5. Open https://jtyneham.github.io/resonance/ on a phone and test.

Pages source must be GitHub Actions; custom domain stays blank. The included
workflow checks and builds before deploying. The first live deployment is not
locally verifiable before the push.

## Remaining product work (after this prototype)

Physical Android/iOS playtesting for timing, thumb comfort, safe-area/fullscreen
behavior and performance. Browser mobile emulation is not physical-phone testing.
Tune the exposed config and chart from that feedback before building The Conductor.
The other bosses, final music/art, calibration and controller support remain later
work. Do not expand into those merely because the user says "continue"; first
inspect any new feedback or deployment result.

## Resume procedure

Read this file and PROTOTYPE_SPEC.md; inspect git diff/status and source files.
Run the existing checks; continue at the earliest incomplete checkpoint.
Completed edits are in this working tree. Do not discard them or restart the project.
The user will commit and push; no remote deployment has occurred yet.
